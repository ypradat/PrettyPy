PrettyPy is a `Python` package that implements nice functions for plotting complex and/or pretty graphics for
visualizing data or displaying analysis results.

## 2 Heatmap plots

### 2.1 Double heatmap

The `double_heatmap` subpackage of the `prettypy` package defines functions for plotting heatmaps of two half-filled
matrices. The function additionally allows to add scattered markers on the half-filled matrices to highlight some cells.

The `double_heatmap` plot in the demo was inspired by the figure S3.a of [the
supplementary](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1516192/suppl_file/nejmoa1516192_appendix.pdf) of the paper
